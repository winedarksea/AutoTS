As an AutoML project, there are many moving parts in this project, and any additions should be done carefully.

Non-spurious contributions are welcome, however, for example, a new model type (see the new model checklist in TO-DO). 
While only limited tests are currently available, it is strongly recommended to include tests for any new code.

Submit pull requests to the `dev` branch where they can be integrated and tested with other code before being released onto main.

Please utilize the `Discussions` area for discussions and any questions, with `Issues` focused on specifically identified bugs or new features.
